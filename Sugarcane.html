<h1>SUGARCANE</h1>
</center>
<center>
<p>  
Sugarcane, (Saccharum officinarum), perennial grass of the family Poaceae, primarily cultivated <br> its juice from which sugar is processed. Most of the world's sugarcane is grown in subtropical and tropical areas. The plant is also grown for biofuel production, especially in Brazil, as the canes can be used directly to produce ethyl alcohol (ethanol). The by-products from cane sugar processing, namely the straw and bagasse (cane fibres), can be used to produce cellulosic ethanol, a second- generation biofuel. Other sugarcane products include molasses, rum, and cachaça (a Brazilian alcohol), and the plant itself can be used as thatch and as livestock fodder. This article treats the cultivation of the sugarcane plant. For information on the processing of cane
sugar and the history of its use, see

    <h3>LAND PREPARATION</h3>
    <center>
    The sugarcane fields are prepared by ploughing 2 to 4 times at the depth of 50-60 cm with a tractor-drawn disc plough or victory plough. The land is then harrowed at a shallow depth of 12-15 cm and crush the clods by disc harrow or rotavator. This is to pulverise and smoothen the compact soil. This should be followed by levelling as uniform crop stand and easy movement for water irrigation is very important. Levelling can be done using a leveller operated on a tractor.

<h3>planting</h3>
<center>
<p>
    Apply basal manures like FYM at 12.5 t/ha or compost at 25 t/ha or filter press mud at 37.5 t/ha before the last ploughing. Then apply sugarcane trash and press mud at a 1:1 ratio. This is followed by the application of rock phosphate, gypsum and urea in the ratio of 2:2:1. This mixture can be combined with cow dung slurry or water for moisture. In the case of working with phosphorus-deprived soil apply 37.5kg/ha of superphosphate along the furrows with a hand hoe.  In the case of working with nutrient-deficient soil, which is deficient in Zinn (Zn) and Iron (Fe), apply 37.5kg of Zinc sulphate/ha and 100 kg of Ferrous sulphate. The seed canes are planted in the furrows in 30 – 45 cm intervals. The seeds are then irrigated on the 3rd or 4th day.

<h3>Water Requirement</h3>
<center>
<p>  
The water requirement per year is around 20,000 to 30,000 cubic meters to raise a good crop. This is equal to 2000 to 3000 mm.
The total water required depends on various factors such as soil type, climatic conditions like rainfall, temperature, wind etc. the cultivation practices, water application efficiency and crop duration. Approximate water requirement of a 12 month sugarcane at each growth phase is indicated below:<br>
</center>

<br>
<br>

a. Germination (0 - 45 days): 300mm<br>
b. Tillering phase (45 - 120 days):550mm<br>
c. Grand growth phase (120-270 days): 1000mm<br>
d. Ripening phase (270 - 360 days):650mm<br>
</p>
<h3>Fertilizer</h3>
<center>
<p>
    Fertilizers are applied to sugarcane from the beginning of planting through the whole growth cycle but not during the ripening period. Optimum amounts of fertilizers (nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium) vary greatly with soil types, climatic conditions, and the kind and length of the growing cycle.
    To secure a good crop, weeds in the cane fields must be attacked until the cane stools develop a good canopy, which
    checks weed growth. Weeding, still
    largely manual, is done with a hoe, though mechanical cane weeders with attached rakes have been developed. Chemical herbicides are widely used.

<h3>
    high-yield
</h3>
<center>
<p>
    To attain good yields, sugarcane requires 2,000 to 2,300 mm (80 to 90 inches) of water during the growing period. When precipitation is deficient, irrigation, either by spraying or by applying water in furrows, can make up for the deficiency. The growth period for cane crops varies considerably
    according to the region: 8-9 months in Louisiana, U.S.; 15 months in Australia and Taiwan; 18-22 months in Hawaii, South Africa, and Peru. The lowest temperature for good cane-plant growth is about 20 °C (68 °F). Continuous cooler temperature promotes the maturation of cane, as does withholding water. Harvesting and milling begin in the dry, relatively cool season of the year and last for five to six months.

<h3>
    Conclusion
</h3>
<center>
<p>Sugarcane can be grown in all irrigated parts of the country. Apart from the water requirement, sugarcane is an easily manageable crop that doesn’t require a lot of maintenance. This is also a high-return crop, with high market demand.</p>
