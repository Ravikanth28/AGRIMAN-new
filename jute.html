</center>
<body>
    <p>
    Jute is a long,rough,shiny bast fiber that can be spun into coarse,strong threads.<br>
    It is produced from flowering plant in the genus corchorus,of the mallow family Malvaceae. <br>
    The primary source of the fiber is Corchorus olitorius,but such fiber is considered inferior to that derived <br>
    from Corchorus capsularis. </p>

    <h2>What is Jute Fabric?</h2>
    <p>
        Jute fabric is a type of textile fiber made from the jute plant. While there are a few different <br>
        botanical varieties of jute one of the main species used to make jute <br>
        fabric is Corchorus olitorius(white jute).However,another species of jute, called <br>
        Corchorus capsularis (tossa jute) is considered to be superior even though it is harder to cultivate.
    </p>
    <p>
        Cotton takes the title of most-produced plant-based fiber, but jute is a close second. While jute isn't <br>
        very popular in the Western world, it is one of the primary textile fibers of India and neighboring countries.<br>
        Jute plants grow to be over 10 feet high, and the fibers derived from these plants are harvested in a <br>
        single long string. Therefore, jute fibers are among the longest natural textile fibers in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
       <h2>Method of Cultivating and Processing of Jute:</h2> 
        Jute is generally sown in February on lowlands and in March-May on uplands.The crop takes <br>
        8-10 months to mature but different varieties take different time to mature.The harvesting period <br>
        generally starts in July and continues till October.
    </p>
    <p>
        To grow jute, farmers first scatter the seeds on cultivated soil. When the plants <br>
        are about 15- 20 cm tall, they are thinned out. About four months after planting, harvesting begins. <br>
        The plants are usually harvested after they flower and before the flowers go to seed. The stalks are<br>
        cut off close to the ground, tied into bundles and soaked in water for about 20 days. This process <br>
        softens the tissues and breaks the hard pectin bond between the bast and hurd (inner woody fibers) and permits <br>
        the fibers to be separated. 
    </p>
        <p>
        The fibers are then stripped from the stalks in long strands and washed in clear, running water.<br>
        Then they are hung up or spread on thatched roofs to dry. After 2-3 days of drying, the fibers are tied into bundles.<br>
        The suitable climate for growing jute is a warm and wet climate, which is offered by the monsoon climate during the<br>
        fall season, immediately followed by summer. Temperatures ranging to more than 25 °C and relative humidity of 70%-90% are <br>
        favorable for successful cultivation. Jute requires 160-200 cm of rainfall yearly with extra needed during the sowing period.<br>
        River basins, alluvial or loamy soils with a pH range between 4.8 and 5.8 are best for jute cultivation. Jute cultivation in red soils <br>
        may require high dosage of manure. Plain land or gentle slope or low land is ideal for jute cultivation. Since the jute seeds are small<br>
        in size, land should be finely tilled, which can be done by careful ploughing.
    </p>
    <p>
        <h2>CROP MANAGEMENT</h2>
<p>
        Jute can be successfully grown in Coimbatore, Cuddalore Villupuram, Vellore, Tiruvannamalai, Chengleput and parts of <br>
        Thanjavur, Tiruvarur, Nagapattinam, Tiruchirapalli, Perambalur Karur, Pudukkottai and Tirunelveli, Thoothukudi districts <br>
        where assured supply of irrigation water is available for its cultivatior and retting for fibre extraction.
<p>

        <h2>Soil type:</h2>
• Alluvial sandy loam, clay loamy soils are best suited for jute production.<br>

•Capsularis jute can grow even in standing water especially towards the latter part of its growth.<br>

• Olitorius jute will not thrive in standing water. The latter is more drought resistant <br>
and is therefore grown on lighte soils.
<h2>Season: February</h2>
<h2>Land Preparation: </h2>Fine tilth is required since the seeds are very small.
<h2>Manures and fertilizer application:</h2>
• Five tonnes of well decomposed farm yard manure is to be applied during last ploughing.<br>
• Besides 20 kg per ha each of N, P205 and K20 are to be applied basally.Beds and <br>
channels are formed depending on wate resources.

<h2>Crop duration: 120 to 140 Days</h2>
<h2>Seed rate and sowing: Seeds can be sown either by broadcasting or by line sowing.</h2>

<h2>Weed management:</h2>
Hand weeding twice on 20 - 25 DAS and 35 - 40 DAS Fluchloralin can be sprayed at 3 days after sowing at the rate of 1.5<br>
 kg per hectare and is followed by irrigation. Further one hand weeding can be taken up at 30-35 DAS.<br>
Top dressing of fertiliser: Apply 10 kg of N at 20 - 25 days after first weeding and then again on<br>
35-40 days after seconc weeding as top dressing. During periods of drought and fertilizer shortage, <br>
spray 8 kg of urea as 2 per cent urea solution (20 g urea in one litre of water) on jute foliage on <br>
40 45 as well as 70-75 DAS.

<h2>Water Management:</h2> Jute crop requires 500 mm of water. Firs irrigation is to be given after sowing and life irrigation or fourth day after sowing. Afterwards irrigation can be giver once in 15 days.
Harvest: Jute crop can be harvested from 100 to 110 DAS bu can be extended from 120 135 DAS depending on loca cropping systems. Jute plants are left in the field for 3 - 4 days for leaf shedding. Then thick and thin plants are sorted ou and bundled in convenient size.
Yield:
• Green plant weight yield is 45 to 50 tonnes per hectare
·
Fibre yield is 2.0 to 2.5 tonnes per hectare.
