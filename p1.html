<p class="p">
    The first step is determining the optimal time 
    for sowing wheat, which varies from type to 
    type. <br>If you want to avoid the negative effects 
    of frost on your growing crop, <br>you should 
    choose a planting time for winter wheat in the 
    late summer/early fall, <br>roughly six to eight 
    weeks before the first frost. The first spring 
    months, when the soil is <br>still chilly, are best 
    suited for planting spring wheat. Common 
    procedures for planting wheat include:
</p>

    <h2 class="p1">Tillage</h2>

     <p class="p2">First and foremost, prepare a field 
    before growing wheat. The recommended 
    depth of <br>soil tilling is 6 inches (15 cm). 
    When you're done, the ground <br>should be at 
    maximum evenness. 
</p>

    <h2 class="p1">Spreading compost (if needed)</h3>
<p class="p2">
    Light brown, overly dry, or slightly rough soil may 
    benefit from being covered with <br> compost.
    This adds nutrients to the soil, which may 
    improve how the plants grow. 
</p>

    <h2 class="p1">Broadcasting seeds</h2> 
<p class="p2">
    This method of 
    sowing wheat entails scattering the seed 
    into the prepared soil, <br>spacing it at a width 
    of about 3 inches (7 cm).If you prefer 
    intercropping or <br>companion planting, 
    increase the spacing between rows of 
    wheat to 8 inches (20cm). <br>The optimal 
    wheat seed planting depth is about 0.5 
    inches (1 cm).
</p>
<h2 class="p1">Putting a thin soil layer over the seeds</h2>
<p class="p2">
    This shields the seed from exposure to the 
    sun and keeps birds from eating <br>it before it 
    can germinate. A 1.5-inch (4-cm) layer is
    ideal for the spring crop, <br> while a 2.5-inch 
    (6.5-cm) layer is 
     recommended for the <br>
    winter crop. Never cover the seeds with 
    over 3 inches (7.5 cm) of soil. <br>
    Watering. Water the plants as soon as 
    possible after planting, and be <br>sure to keep 
    the newly planted area consistently moist 
    until the plant sprouts and grows stronger.

<h2 class="p1">PHYSICAL METHODS OF WEED CONTROL</h2> 
<p class="p2" >

</p>
<ul class="p2">
    1.Pulling out weeds by hand or uprooting weeds by using 
    small hand tool <br>is known as hand weeding. 
</ul>
<ul class="p2">
    2.Two aspects are important in hand weeding: the number of 
    hand weedings to be <br>done and the interval between two 
    hand weedings.
</ul>
<ul class="p2">
    3.The number of hand weedings to be done depends on crop growth,<br>
     weed growth and critical period of crop-weed competition. 
</ul>
<ul class="p2">
    4. The number of hand weedings range from 2-4 for most of 
    the field crops. 
</ul>
<ul class="p2">
    5.The interval between two weedings depends on the 
    quickness of weed growth <br>which interferes with crop growth.Generally ,it is 15-20 days
</ul>

<h2 class="p1">Best Care Practices For Growing Wheat</h2>
<p class="p2">
    Growing this crop is a challenging endeavor. The final yield can be drastically lowered or even <br>destroyed by a number of different causes.
    The following are examples of major dangers to growing wheat.
</p>
<ol class="p2">
inadequate cultivation of the soil.
</ol>
<ol class="p2">
choosing an unsuitable plant variety for your region.
</ol>
<ol class="p2">
improper watering techniques.
</ol>
<ol class="p2">
poor disease and pest management.
</ol>
<p class="p2">
There’s not much you can do if you didn’t get the soil ready for planting or used a plant variety<br> that doesn’t grow well in your area.
Still, you can manage irrigation and fertilizing, <br>control the spread of crop diseases and pests, and otherwise take care of your growing wheat.<br>
Let’s take a closer look at the methods of crop management that will help you grow a good yield.
</p>
<h2 class="p1">Fertilizing</h2>
<p class="p2">
NPK (nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium) is a necesary fertilizer for growing wheat.
Current high-yield varieties are <br>more efficient at extracting nitrogen (N) from the soil, which makes them richer in protein 
. <br>Keep in mind, that grain yield is inversely proportional to grain protein content.
That’s why<br> it’s crucial that farmers strike the ideal balance between protein composition and <br>
yield when planning their nitrogen fertilization schedules and dosages.
</p>
<p class="p2">
Farmers can employ the variable rate application (VRA) method to add the optimal <br>amount of nitrogen fertilizer
to their growing wheat, preventing nitrogen overload <br>and the resulting low yields.
Taking the vegetation map as a guide, you may split your <br>field into zones, determine how much 
nitrogen fertilizer each zone needs, and figure out how much money<br> you’ll save in the process.
By using variable rate technology (VRT) to fertilize <br>your growing crops based on site-specific needs, 
you may reduce the amount of money and <br>fertilizer that is wasted as runoff.
</p>

<h2 class="p1">Watering</h2>
<p class="p2">
Watering at just the right times is crucial for efficient wheat growing.<br>
Early irrigation for winter variety contributes to quicker and more even plant emergence, <br>
stronger crop establishment, and a greater yield per land area. The spring crop also<br> requires a 
lot of water throughout the germination and early root development stages. <br>
To speed up the emergence of young seedlings and foster early root development, <br>gentle, 
frequent watering is recommended.
</p>

<p class="p2">
Wheat needs the most water during the flowering stage, an average of<br> 0.19 inches (0.5 cm) per day. 
The soil needs to be kept damp enough before blooming begins <br>so that the crop 
can thrive through the flowering stage and the early grain stage.
</p>

<h2 class="p1">How Long Does Wheat Take To Grow?</h2>
<p class="p2">
    Spring wheat needs about 100–130 days to grow, while growing winter wheat takes <br>about 180–250 days. 
    Winter wheat growth time includes up to 90 days during<br> the colder months when it goes dormant.

    Factors like warmth (especially soil temperature) and precipitation/irrigation <br>affect how long
    it takes for the plant to grow. The winter type, for instance, needs<br> more time to
    mature in frozen climates because there are more days with no <br>potential for growth 
    there, lengthening the wheat growth period. On the other hand, it’s <br>possible that 
    even a moderate lack of water during the vegetative stage can <br>speed up the crop growing process.
</p>
<h2 class="p1">How To Harvest Wheat And Handle Its Grain</h2>

<p class="p2">
    Harvesting winter wheat is best in late spring or early <br>summer, while the spring 
    crop is reaped from the middle of summer to early fall. When there<br> is no trace 
    of green left in the growing crop and it has turned a golden yellow, <br>you know it’s 
    harvest-ready. Examining the grain’s hardness is another way<br> to ensure 
    the crop is ripe. Firm grain means that wheat is ready for harvest.
</p>
<h2 class="p1">Harvesting Wheat</h2>

<p class="p2">
    Thankfully, we no longer harvest wheat on a massive scale using manual labor.<bR> 
    Today, combines harvest the crop from large fields. This agricultural <br>machine 
    simultaneously gathers, threshes, and winnows grain. The combine also <br>cuts up the 
    crop residue into tiny bits, which are then broadcast across the field <br>by the rear discharge.

    To prevent significant declines in grain quality, wheat should be <br>picked as soon as 
    it has dried down to around 12.5% grain moisture content. If you’re<br> 
    concerned about quality losses due to rain or poor weather, harvesting at<br>
    a little higher moisture content (say, 18%) could be helpful. Grain should<br>
    still be dried to a moisture content of less than 12% after harvest to prevent<br>
    the risk of fungi and mycotoxins developing during storage.
</p>

<h2 class="p1">Wheat Grain Post-Harvest Handling</h2>

<p class="p2">
    Moisture levels below 12%, preferably 10%, allow grains to be safely stored for<br>
     long periods of time. When grain is kept in bags, its moisture level needs to <br.
     be even lower, at 9%. Grain dryers are used to reduce the moisture content <br>
     of harvested wheat to this level.<br>

    Once the grain has been dried, it is stored in special buildings such as silos, <br>
    bunkers/pits, and grain bags. To avoid wasting grain, here is a <br>
    checklist for storing it properly:<br>
</p>
<ol class="p2">
    place only healthy grains in the facility.
</ol>
<ol class="p2">
    only use silos that have been paved, leveled, tidy, dry, and moisture-insulated;
    properly ventilate the storage facility.
</ol>
<ol class="p2">
    maintain a 10-foot (3-meter) buffer zone around the containers, free of growing plants and grain residue.
</ol>
<ol class="p2">
    keep the grains safe from bugs and moisture by using special chemicals.
</ol>
<ol class="p2">
    conduct routine checkups of the grain’s condition.
</ol>
<p class="p2">
    Wheat is not the easiest crop to grow. However, if you follow the advice in this article <br>
    and make use of modern agricultural technologies, you can ensure a good harvest<br>
     even if you don’t have much experience growing wheat. Now, you also don’t have <br>
     to invest a ton of time, money, or effort to stay updated on the situation in your fields. <br>
     Making use of modern, advanced machinery and technologies paves the way <br>
     for truly efficient wheat growing.
